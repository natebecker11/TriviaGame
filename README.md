# Trivia Game
A trivia game made for CWRU Coding Bootcamp 

## Core features
The player will be able to click the start button, and upon doing so the first question will be presented to them. A 30-second timer will begin to tick down. The player will click one of the four choices. On a right answer, they will be told they are correct. On a wrong answer, or if time runes out, they will be told they are incorrect and what the right answer was. In all cases, an image will be displayed as well. After 5 seconds, the next question will automatically appear. After all questions, a results screen will display showing number of questions correct/incorrect/unanswered. A 'play again' button will restart the game without reloading the page.
